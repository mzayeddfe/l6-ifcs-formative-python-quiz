    "\n",
    "This project is a modular Python quiz application with a graphical interface. It is designed for formative assessment in the Intensive Foundations of Computer Science and Programming course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple quiz app. When you run it, a window will appear with questions and a text input field for answers. Type your answer and click the \"Submit\" button. At the end, your score will be shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do I use it?**\n",
    "1. [Install dependencies](#installing-dependencies) if you do not already have them.\n",
    "2. [Run the quiz app](#how-to-run-the-quiz-app)\n",
    "3. Answer the questions as they appear.\n",
    "4. At the end, see your score!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "You need Python 3.x installed. Tkinter is usually included with Python. If you have Python, you likely have everything you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Python, visit: https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Run the Quiz App\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download or clone this repository to your computer.\n",
    "2. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and navigate to the project folder. Note if the `l6-ifcs-formative-python-quiz` folder is nested inside other folders, you will need to specify this in the path below before the repository folder and separate them by `/`:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd l6-ifcs-formative-python-quiz\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Run the following command:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python run_quiz.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. The quiz window will appear. Answer the questions and see your score at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- `quiz_logic.py`: Contains the `Quiz` class for managing questions and scoring.\n",
    "- `quiz_questions.py`: Stores the quiz questions and answers in a list.\n",
    "- `quiz_gui.py`: Implements the Tkinter graphical interface (`QuizApp` class).\n",
    "- `run_quiz.py`: Launches the quiz application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developer Manual\n",
    "\n",
    "- To add or change questions, edit the `quiz_questions` list in `quiz_questions.py`.\n",
    "- All quiz logic is separated from the interface for easy maintenance and extension.\n",
    "- You can further extend the app by adding new features or changing the interface in `quiz_gui.py`.\n"

    "\n",
